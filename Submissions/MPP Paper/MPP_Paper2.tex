  \abstract{Enter abstract here. Each new line herein must be indented, like this
line.

How do we break down representations of events to encode them in
language? Across languages, most verbs encode either Ends (e.g.~what
happens, crossing the floor) or Means (e.g.~how it happens, by dancing)
of an event, but not both (cf.~Talmy, 1985). Havasi et al. (2014) showed
these biases are not fixed but malleable -- when adults and 4-6yos learn
several verbs in a row with path meanings (rise, cross), they begin to
guess subsequent novel verbs will refer to path as well. For adults,
these biases are very abstract: after adults learned a path bias for
motion events, they preferred Ends verbs for change-of-state scenes as
well (Geojo 2015). Accomplishing this requires some kind of very general
representation of events that can account for hitting (manner-of-action)
being more like running (manner-of-motion) than like entering (path).

Pre-linguistic infants are sensitive to a non-linguistic means/ends
distinction (Phillips \& Wellman, 2005; Woodward, 1998, Gergely et al.
2002), but we do not know whether this early conceptual framework
provides a foundation for learning verb semantics. Are parallels between
means/end structure across domains a late-learned cognitive skill, or do
they emerge early in development? 4-6-yo children (N=58) were presented
with a repeating learning sequence (Figure 1):

Bias/new verb test: A word/event pairing is presented (e.g.~comb-rip,
gorping); children choose whether gorping means an event maintaining
either action (comb-flatten) or effect (hammer-rip).

Training: 3 additional events provide evidence for one interpretation
(e.g.~effect, rip)

Same-verb Test: 2 new events matching either action (comb-open) or
effect (plier-rip)

Children saw 8 trials in the same domain (change-of-state) and then 8 in
a new domain, directed motion. Our key interest is \textbf{\emph{not in
the learning of individual verbs}} (measured at 3), but in the biases
that children develop between verbs (measured at step 1 of each
subsequent trial). We ask (a) if children's verb biases update with
evidence within the change-of-state domain and (b) whether these biases
extend between domains, relying on an abstract means/end distinction.

We are just beginning to understand how the cognitive abilities children
show in the first year of life help to organize language learning, and
in particular how children conceptualize and break down their
representations of events into verb and sentence meaning. These results
suggest that children's verb meanings draw on very abstract lexical
semantics from childhood, and that these have parallel structure -- and
may be related to -- the fundamental cognitive representations available
to infants.}

Introduction outline

I. Motivate the big question/effects

Why do we have the type of linguistic system we have? Beyond question of
nature/nurture or particular syntactic theories, it's clear that
langauges make distinctions between e.g.~actions and objects.
Fundamental, built in. Why? Because they matter for cmmunication, either
how we talk about or what we want to talk about. Meets our needs.

It MATTERS which representaitonal basis we have. Effects are everywhere.
We make predictions about word meaning (Adult novel verb and
\enquote{human simulation} stuff), subtly- or not so subtly - update
meaning of words based on sentence structure (\enquote{Crash} effects
and Wolf), find verbs natural or unnatural in sentences (some rating
studies?), struggle or dont' struggle to access a word in a particular
frame (Priming). Psycholinguistic theories assume that these effects are
all driven by some shared underlying cognitive representations.
Linguistic theories provide concrete proposals for the nature of these
representations (they won't all agree that we're doing this.)

Empirical evidence for these is good for both psycholiinguistcs,
linguistics, and rest of cognition, which often struggles to describe
events and missing distinctions we believe to be important. IT PUTS A
CONSTRAINT. WE REALLY WANT EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR REPRESENTATIONAL FORM.
NOAH's CRYSTALLOGRAPHY METAPHOR.

Define resarch qurtion - usually talk about verb classes
(\enquote{cummunication}) but the proposal that they're broader and have
general principles and cross cutting, we explore that.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Roman{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Word meaning and conceptual structure.
\end{enumerate}

A. What is the content of mental representaitons of verbs? WELL Nouns.
They work like this. Conceptual components/dimensions - Take people on
the Dedre Gentner ride.

Returning to nouns, mass/count distinction implies totally independent
evidence for Spelke Objets by age 1 - they might have them much earlier,
but to the extent they really have adultlike mass count (debatable),
they have the principle.

B. How are verbs different? WELL for one thing baseball example.

Is it everything goes as far as perpsectives? Seems like NO. Use
give/receive. Or Use dimensions? CONTRAST nouns: they refer to knids,
traits tend to cluster (mutually predictive borders and hang together).
Check the cogsci version of Havasi paper 2013. Vber stend to spread,
picka dimension of carem like cause or contact.

\enquote{mental representation of events} is a bit too broad for us; as
with other cass the quyestion of whether noun representaiotn = object
representaiton is HUGE, and we leave it aside. BUT, we see evidence for
SOME kinds fo perspective taking, across langauges and theories

C. TWO PRINCIPLE OF LING THEORY TYPES vis a vis generalities. NEEDS TO
STAY SHORT!

D. WHEN GENERAL, Proposals tend to return to some common themes (cause,
agency) etc.; it's nota new idea that thesea re connected to early
cognition. WHO CARES Which is true? WELL, Theories of early cognition
also turn on questions of whether access to such representations. It
could be independent, or not, BUT THEY MUST MAP TO EACH OTHER. Thus the
linguistic achievements (if we're right about their representational
forms) of young children are a key insignt to their conceptual
structure, and the acquisition of these strucutres puts constraints on
learning.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Roman{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  SPECIFIC REPRESENTATION TO TARGT: MANNER/RESULT
\end{enumerate}

So, how we proceed? Now for the first time in the paper talk about
Manner/Result. ANd which is it! Talmy goes here; talk about interest in
xlinguistics BUT we move on. Say explicitly that readers (lang acq) with
this background will get confused. That literature is important but not
what we're talking about.

Jesse's first paper establishes it's coherent, AND that it's learnable.
Nice, suggests we're talking about reasonable familira kinds of concepts
not some weird langauage thing. But what is the SCOPE? Put a diagram
here, probably. Why think limited? SYNTAX. NOT OBVIOUS TO LANGUAGE USER!
Why think broad? TWO INDEPENDENT STORIES, echoing the nouns again. IF WE
CAN SHOW which it is, and developmental course, can understand basis for
THIS representation, and also geenral way to understand event
representation. Cite that Brent paper that annyos me.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Roman{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  THIS STUDIES
\end{enumerate}

We'll do 2 things. Establsih evidence for reality (replicated Havasi),
show adult. Make predictions about kids afterwards (defer to then), but
then look at developmental course. This is the roadmap.

SEPARATE FOR DISCUSION: See Behrend Farer Tomaello Gentner for this
stuff, especially on wheter we like manner or result more, which
learning ios thjere./ \enquote{Behrend wrote a second paper}. Timeline
is about 1977-185, then it goes away.

\section{Experiment 0 Experimental
Design}\label{experiment-0-experimental-design}

It's difficult! You need to understand it one time! In the epxeriments,
we'll describe deviations.

TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY ARE CONFUSED ABOUT AND HOW NOT TO BE.

GENERAL NOTE: In analyses, make sure that item effects don't treat an
item in Causal and an item in MOtion as equivalent - there's no
pairing!!
